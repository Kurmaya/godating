They book the date by paying a fee. This fee covers the platform's maintenance and ensures a genuine interest in meeting up. <br>→ Guest: The person who receives the date invitation and confirms their attendance becomes the Guest. They are not charged a fee.</p>

                        <p>The review and rating feature plays a crucial role in maintaining a positive and genuine user experience on Go Dating. <br> After a completion of the date, both the Host and Guest will have the opportunity to anonymously rate and review their experience. <br> 
                            This helps: 
                            <br>→ Improve Matches: Reviews can highlight positive qualities or areas for improvement, allowing users to make informed decisions about potential dates. 
                            <br>→ Maintain a High Standard: Knowing their profiles will be reviewed motivates users to be respectful and genuine during their interactions. 
                            <br>→ Build Trust: Positive reviews from past dates can increase someone's credibility and chances of securing more matches.</p>

            <div class="about-desc">
                <p>In today's dating scene, we're all stuck in a never-ending cycle of swiping through profiles that look more <br>and more alike.  </p>
<p>The stats don't lie: Roughly 20 million Indians used dating apps just five years ago. This figure surged by a <br>massive 293% since then and hit 82.4 million in 2023. However, a significant number of users are <br> dissatisfied with their current dating app experience.</p>
<p>Why the disconnect? Traditional dating apps leave us feeling like cogs in a machine, endlessly swiping with <br>no real connection or control. Who even remembers the last profile that sparked a genuine interest?</p>
<p>With Go Dating, we're ditching the endless texting for a more human approach – a virtual speed dating <br>experience where you connect with interesting people and book confirmed dates. Imagine the excitement <br>of knowing your date is actually showing up, ready for a fun, real-life interaction!</p>
<p>Plus, with Go Dating, you're in control. Set your preferences (Host or Guest), choose who initiates dates, <br>and spark genuine connections based on shared interests. </p>
<p>No more ghosting, no more awkward first-message struggles. Just real people, real dates, and a chance to <br> rewrite your love story.</p>
