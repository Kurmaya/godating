You can create a profile, browse matches, and chat with people you're interested in at no cost. <br> However, there's a unique twist: There is a fee to book and schedule your date at a partner venue. <br>   Here's how it works: <br> → Host: The person who initiates the date becomes the host. They book the date by paying a fee. This fee covers the platform's maintenance and ensures a genuine interest in meeting up. <br>→ Guest: The person who receives the date invitation and confirms their attendance becomes the Guest. They are not charged a fee.</p>

                        <p>After a Guest accepts the invitation for a date, 10% of the set amount reflects in the guest’s wallet. The chat option unlocks 24 hours prior to the scheduled date. At the time of the actual date, the guest receives a QR code which must be scanned by the Host in order to confirm the meeting. Following this the remaining hearts will reflect in the Guest’s wallet, if the Guest chooses to keep the hearts as a gift. Guests receive a total of 80% of the amount that they decide upon for each date. 20% is deducted as platform fee. <br>
                            If the Guest chooses to use the hearts to pay for the date, 80% of the amount is transferred to the partner venue directly by Go Dating. 20% is deducted as platform fee.

                <p>In today's dating scene, we're all stuck in a never-ending cycle of swiping through profiles that look more <br>and more alike.  </p>
<p>The stats don't lie: Roughly 20 million Indians used dating apps just five years ago. This figure surged by a <br>massive 293% since then and hit 82.4 million in 2023. However, a significant number of users are <br> dissatisfied with their current dating app experience.</p>
<p>Why the disconnect? Traditional dating apps leave us feeling like cogs in a machine, endlessly swiping with <br>no real connection or control. Who even remembers the last profile that sparked a genuine interest?</p>
<p>With Go Dating, we're ditching the endless texting for a more human approach – a virtual speed dating <br>experience where you connect with interesting people and book confirmed dates. Imagine the excitement <br>of knowing your date is actually showing up, ready for a fun, real-life interaction!</p>
<p>Plus, with Go Dating, you're in control. Set your preferences (Host or Guest), choose who initiates dates, <br>and spark genuine connections based on shared interests. </p>
<p>No more ghosting, no more awkward first-message struggles. Just real people, real dates, and a chance to <br> rewrite your love story.</p>
