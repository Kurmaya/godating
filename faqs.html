                        <p>Go Dating is a free-to-use mobile application! You can create a profile, browse matches, and chat with people you're interested in at no cost. <br> However, there's a unique twist: There is a fee to book and schedule your date at a partner venue. <br>   Here's how it works: <br> → Host: The person who initiates the date becomes the host. They book the date by paying a fee. This fee covers the platform's maintenance and ensures a genuine interest in meeting up. <br>→ Guest: The person who receives the date invitation and confirms their attendance becomes the Guest. They are not charged a fee.</p>
